# Hexgate

[Hexgate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexgate) is a work-in-progress LCU suite. It is **not** endorsed by Riot Games. You can find out more about what that means [here](https://www.riotgames.com/en/legal). Thank you Riot ❤️ for providing a public API for us to play with.

## Scope

Hexgate is currently ESM-only and it's not intended for use in browsers (the LoL client does not allow browser connections). If CJS support is important to you, please open an issue. I am aware electron still lacks ESM support.

## Installation

Add it to your own project using your favorite package manager.

```shell
pnpm add hexgate
```

```shell
npm i hexgate
```

```shell
yarn add hexgate
```

## Development

This package uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to manage dependencies. If you don't have pnpm, it can be installed globally using `npm`, `yarn`, `brew`, or `scoop`, as well as some other options. Check out the [pnpm documentation](https://pnpm.io/installation) for more information.

```ps1
pnpm i
```
